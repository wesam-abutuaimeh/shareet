# Welcome to the shareet repository!

This website was built for a real client who wanted a professional platform for their photo shooting business

## As the lead front-end developer on the project, I was responsible for creating the visually stunning and user-friendly interface that you see today.

Using the latest technologies in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted a responsive design that looks great on all devices and optimizes the user experience. I also implemented various interactive features such as image galleries and a booking form to enhance the functionality of the site.
In this repository, you'll find the source code for the shareet website, as well as documentation and assets related to the development process. I hope you'll take a moment to browse through the code and see the care and attention that went into building this site.

### If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.

I'm always looking to improve my skills and would love to hear your thoughts on the shareet project .
